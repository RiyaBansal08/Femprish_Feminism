            <h1>Women’s movements and the history of feminism</h1>
            <p>There have been many extraordinary women who have played an important role in local or world history, but
                not all of these have necessarily been advocates of women’s issues. <strong>The women’s movement is made
                    up of
                    women and men who work and fight to achieve gender equality and to improve the lives of women as a
                    social group.</strong> In most societies, women were traditionally confined to the home as
                daughters, wives and
                mothers, and we are often only aware of women in history because of their relation to famous men. Of
                course many women throughout history did in fact play an important role in cultural and political life,
                but they tend to be invisible. An organised women’s movement only really started in the 19th century,
                even though women activists and the struggle for equality have always been part of all human societies.

                <br><br><strong>One of the early pioneers, who thought and wrote about women as a group, is the Italian
                    writer Christine
                    de Pizan, who published a book about women’s position in society as early as 1495.</strong>
                Christine de Pizan
                wrote about books she had read by famous men, who wrote books about the sins and weaknesses of girls and
                women, and questioned whether women were really human beings at all, or whether they were more similar
                to animals. Christine de Pizan’s work offers a good example of the early stages of the struggle for
                women’s equality. However, she was very unusual in being able to read and write, which was not at all
                common for women of that time.

                    style="float: right;" alt="">
                In later history, women took part in the French revolution from the very beginning: the
                demonstrations that led to the revolution started with a large group of working women marching to
                Versailles to demand not only food to feed their families, but also political change. However, the
                French Revolution did not lead to proper recognition of women’s rights. For that reason, in
                September 1791, Olympe de Gouges wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female
                Citizen, in response to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and with the
                intention of exposing the failure of the French Revolution to recognise gender equality. As a result
                of her writings de Gouges was accused, tried and convicted of treason, resulting in her immediate
                execution.

                <br><br><strong>The women’s movement began to develop in North America, mainly because women there were
                    allowed
                    to go to
                    school earlier than in Europe</strong> - and women who can read and write, and who are encouraged to
                think for
                themselves, usually start to question how society works. The first activists travelled around North
                America and fought for the end of both slavery and women’s oppression. They organised the ‘First Women’s
                Rights Convention’ in 1848, and continued to campaign to improve the social position of all women. The
                movement also began in Europe with the same broad aims: activists collected signatures demanding that
                working women should receive their own wages and not their husbands’, that women should be able to own a
                house and have custody of their children.
            </p>
            <h3>First wave of feminism</h3>
            <p>The fight for women’s right to vote in elections is known as the ‘suffragette movement’. By the end of
                the 19th century, this had become a worldwide movement, and the words ‘feminism’ and ‘feminist movement’
                started to be used from that point on.

                This <strong></strong>first wave of feminism activism</strong> included mass demonstrations, the
                publishing of newspapers,
                organised debates, and the establishment of international women’s organisations. By the 1920s, women had
                won the right to vote in most European countries and in North America. At around the same time, women
                became more active in communist, socialist and social democratic parties because increasing numbers of
                women began to work outside the home in factories and offices. <strong>Women were first allowed to go to
                    university in the early 20th century, having both a career and a family.</strong> In certain
                countries, when
                fascist parties gained power the feminist movement was banned.

                Women started organising again after the end of the Second World War, and they soon gained equal
                political rights in most European countries, with women’s emancipation becoming an important aim and
                most women being allowed to take on full-time jobs, divorce their husbands and go to university.</p>
            <h3>Second wave of feminism</h3>
            <p><img class="mov-img"
                    src="https://www.coe.int/documents/61989255/67584870/Feminism3.jpg/860ec088-8658-1196-e746-e01d2dafce69?t=1588846085000"
                    style="float: left; margin-right:0.5em" alt="">
                In Western Europe and the USA, the feminist movement was resurgent by the 1970s. Although this
                <strong>second
                    wave of feminism aimed to achieve ‘women’s liberation’</strong>, different groups had different
                ideas about how
                this should be done. Liberal feminists wanted better equality laws and reform of institutions such
                as
                schools, churches and the media. Radical feminists argued that the root cause of women’s inequality
                is
                patriarchy: men, as a group, oppress women. They also focused on violence against women by men and
                started to talk about violence in the family, and rape. <strong>Socialist feminists argued that it
                    is a
                    combination of patriarchy and capitalism that causes women’s oppression.</strong>

                The second wave of feminism also <strong>resulted in new areas of science</strong>: women’s studies
                became a discipline
                to be studied at university, and books began to be published about women’s achievements in
                literature,
                music and science, and recording women’s previously unwritten history.

                Finally, the women’s movement played an important role in the drafting of international documents
                about
                women’s rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the
                Elimination
                of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979).

            <h3>Third wave of feminism</h3>
            <p>The <strong>third wave of feminism</strong> mainly refers to the American movement in the 1990s, and was
                a reaction to the
                <strong>backlash</strong> of conservative media and politicians announcing the end of feminism or
                referring to
                ‘post-feminism’. The term ‘backlash’ was popularised by Susan Faludi in her book Backlash. The
                Undeclared War against Women, published in 1991, and describing the negative reaction of the patriarchal
                system towards women’s liberation. This was hardly a new phenomenon: women’s movements had always been
                met with antagonism. However, in the 1980s, institutionalised forms of attacks on women’s rights grew
                stronger. <strong>The third wave of feminism can be characterised by an increased awareness of
                    overlapping
                    categories, such as race, class, gender, sexual orientation.</strong> More emphasis was also placed
                on racial
                issues, including the status of women in other parts of the world (global feminism). This was also a
                moment when <strong>a number of feminist non-governmental organisations were established</strong>, but
                focusing on
                specific feminist issues, rather than claiming to represent general feminist ideas.

                <strong>Third wave feminism actively uses media and pop culture to promote its ideas and to run
                    activities</strong>, for
                example by publishing blogs or e-zines. It focuses on bringing feminism closer to the people’s daily
                lives. The main issues that third wave feminists are concerned about include: sexual harassment,
                domestic violence, the pay gap between men and women, eating disorders and body image, sexual and
                reproductive rights, honour crimes and female genital mutilation.
            </p>
            <h3>Cyberfeminism and networked feminism (fourth-wave feminism)</h3>
            <p>The term <strong>cyberfeminism is used to describe the work of feminists interested in theorising,
                    critiquing,
                    and making use of the Internet, cyberspace, and newmedia technologies</strong> in general. The term
                and movement
                grew out of 'third-wave' feminism. However, the exact meaning is still unclear to some: even at the
                first meeting of cyberfeminists The First Cyberfeminist International (FCI) in Kassel (Germany),
                participants found it hard to provide a definition, and as a result of discussions, they proposed 100
                anti-theses52 (with reference to Martin Luther’s theses) on what cyberfeminism is not. These included,
                for example, it is not an institution, it is not an ideology, it is not an –ism.

                <strong>Cyberfeminism is considered to be a predecessor of ‘networked feminism’</strong>, which refers
                generally to
                feminism on the Internet: for example, mobilising people to take action against sexism, misogyny or
                gender-based violence against women. One example is the <strong>online movement #metoo</strong> in 2017,
                which was a
                response on social networks from women all over the world to the case of Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood
                producer who was accused of sexually harassing female staff in the movie industry.
